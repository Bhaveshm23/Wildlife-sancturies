        <h1> Sariska National Park</h1>
        <p>The Sariska Tiger Reserve is one of the most famous national parks in India located in the Alwar district of the state of Rajasthan. Originally a hunting preserve of the erstwhile Alwar state, the area was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. In 1978, it was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger scheme. The present area of the park is 866 kmÂ². The park is situated 107 km from Jaipur and 200 km from Delhi.</p>
<p>The reserve is also the location of several archeological sites such as the Neelkanth Mahadev Temple and Garh Rajor temples from the 9th and 10th centuries. The 17th-century Kankwadi fort, located near the center of the park, was where the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb briefly imprisoned his brother Dara Shikoh in the battle for succession of the Mughal throne. The area also has historical buildings associated with the Maharajas of Alwar such as the Sariska Palace, which was used as a royal hunting lodge of Maharaja Jai Singh.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sariska_Tiger_Reserve"><img src="http://www.jimcorbettnational-park.com/images/readmore.jpg" alt="corbett details" align="right"></a>

<p>There is an ancient isolated fort in the forest reserve. This fort is said to be built by Aurangzeb to imprison his elder borther Dara Shekoh. The fort is called Kankarwari. The fort is not well maintained but the views are nice and provide breathtaking panaromic view of the valley. It is a steep climb to the top of a hill where the fort is built.

There are the ruins of a temple complex where excavations are still occuring and one of the prominent temples is the Pandupol temple and not the Neelkantha temple, as some people mistake it to be. Legends says here Bhim was tested by Lord Hanuman for strength and humility. The ruins date back to a period between 6th and 13th century. The broken yet noble statues lying littered on the grounds tantalisingly tease and will not yield their secrets easily. It is a fascinating place for those that have a passion for romance with the past..</p>
<p>Some of the wildlife found in the Sariska Tiger Reserve include the Bengal tiger, leopard, jungle cat, hyena, jackal, chital, sambar, caracal, langur, wild boar, four-horned deer (chowsingha) and several species of birds. The reserve's tiger population nearly disappeared in 2005, however after sustained efforts by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and state government of Rajasthan, the crisis was averted. There are no Tigers, currently (2008). However the forests do have Deer - Sambar, Monkeys and Nilgay.

Three tigers were relocated in Sariska from Ranthombor tiger reserve in 2008 & 2009. on Aug 2013 there are 9 tigers in sariska ,of this 2 are born in sariska rest are relocated from Ranthombor.</p>
