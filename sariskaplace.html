<p>The park surrounds a couple of historical spots that are also frequented by tourists such as the ancient 'Kankawadi Fort', the 'Nilkanth Temple', both built by the local Bargujars, and the Sariska Palace. The national park is now being visited for a lot more reasons than just the wildlife. However, the deciduous, acacia woods, the safaris and the marsh animals by the lake are still the popular highlights of the wildlife sanctuary. Endangered species, such as the Indian tigers, are commonly sighted at this national park, and are also the highlights here. 'Pandupole' is a popular pilgrimage spot build by the mythological characters, the 'Pandavas', which is also flocked by tourists and pilgrims alike.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:40px;">Kankwadi or Kankwari is the site of Kankwadi fort and village, located in the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar district.

The fort was founded by Jai Singh I as a famine work.[1] In the 17th century, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb briefly imprisoned his brother Dara Shikoh in the struggle for the succession of the Mughal throne.

The village was evicted in 2009,[2] but renovation works in the fort are going on to promote tourism.[3] As of August 2016, only three families reside in the village below the fort, but their migration is in progress by the government.

The fort remains open from October to July end throughout the year and anyone can visit it after renting a Safari Jeep from the Forest Office.</p>
