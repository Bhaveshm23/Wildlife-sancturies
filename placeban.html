		<p style="margin-left:40px;">Also known as BR Hills, Biligirirangan is a hill range that forms the south-eastern border of Karnataka. The place is known for Biligiriranganatha Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary or simply BRT Wildlife Sanctuary that is said to be situated on the confluence of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. Thus it is evident that the sanctuary is home to a unique eco-system. The BR hills links the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats, which eventually allows animals to move between the two ghats and even facilitates the gene flow between populations of species in these areas. Thus, this sanctuary can be reckoned to serve as an important biological bridge for the biota of the entire Deccan plateau.</p>
