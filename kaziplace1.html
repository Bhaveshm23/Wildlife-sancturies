For the wildlife lovers, there are some counterparts of Kaziranga National Park that are a must visit like Manas National Park, Nameri National Park, Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary, Orang National Park, Pobitora National Park, and Dibru-Saikhowa National Park. In this list of wildlife reserves, Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary can offer a unique experience, owing to its population of hoolock gibbons, and Northeast India's only nocturnal primate - the Bengal slow loris.

	<h3><b>Guwahati</b></h3>

		<div class="polaroid">

		</div>
		<p>The gateway to the Northeast, and the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the region, Guwahati serves as the starting point for most itineraries. It’s a somewhat featureless city – a prosaic heap of glass and concrete for the most part – but there's a scattering of interesting temples to explore. And if you walk the back alleys and old quarters, you'll glean a generous amount of local flavour, which lingers amid the suburban sprawl of ponds, palm trees, small single-storey traditional houses and colonial-era mansions.</p>
