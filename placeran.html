		<p style="margin-left:40px;">Agra has long been renowned as the city of the Taj Mahal. This has often overshadowed the fact that this royal Mughal has, in addition to the legendary Taj, many magnificent monuments that epitomise the high point of the Mughal architectural achievement. Not even Delhi the seat of kings and emperors for over a thousand years, can boast such a heritage of architectural and cultural splendour from the golden age of the Great Mughals.</p>

	<h3><b>Bharatpur</b></h3>
	<br><br>
		<div class="polaroid">

		<p>An erstwhile princely, Bharatpur is also often called the "Eastern Gateway of Rajasthan. Keolodeo Ghana National Park is an important international bio-sphere known for its large and varied avifauna, both local and migratory. By building small dykes and dams and diverting water from an irrigation canal, he converted this low lying area into a fine wild fowl shooting preserve. In a few years, the new wetland surrounded by marginal forests was able to support thousands of water-birds. Commonly referred to as Bharatpur, the Park is a delight for bird watchers.</p>

	<h3><b>Jaipur</b></h3>

		<p>Jaipur was founded by Maharaja Jai Singh II (1693-1743), is the capital of Rajasthan. It is a major attraction for the first-time visitor. Jaipur is surrounded on all sides by rugged hills, crowned with forts & enclosed by embattled walls. Jaipur was and remains the only city in the world, symbolising the nine divisions of the universe, through nine rectangular sectors sub-dividing it. Jaipur is a royal city & this is its most noticeable aspect, small buildings & festivals testify it.<br><br>Jaipur & its surroundings are rather like an endless museum. The city also offers an endless variety of crafts.</p>
