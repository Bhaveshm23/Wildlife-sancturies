        <h1> Kaziranga National Park</h1>
        <p>Kaziranga National Park is the name to exemplify the most popular conservation efforts to save the endangered species like one-horned rhinoceros in India. Located in the Golaghat and Nagaon district of Assam, this most notable wildlife sanctuary is being declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in the year 1985.</p>
<p>The park resides at an edge of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot and this could be the perfect reason to envision high degrees of diversified species with great visibility.
The park lies in the flood plains of Brahmaputra River and so every year the region is completely drenched with high water level; so do the wildlife gets affected by it too. And keeping such messy situation in mind, the park officials are always ready for every kind of provision for the safety of the jungle beings of Kaziranga.Lying between the latitudes of 26째30' N and 26째45' N, and longitudes 93째08' E to 93째36' E within two districts of Assam, Golaghat and Nagaon, the Kaziranga National Park is stretched across an area of 378 sq km with an addition of 429 sq km along the present boundary of the park. <br><br><a href="http://www.kaziranga-national-park.com"><img src="http://www.jimcorbettnational-park.com/images/readmore.jpg" alt="corbett details" align="right"></a>

<p> From the land of one-horned rhinos to their protected area, the history of Kaziranga takes us back in the year 1904 when the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon along with his wife Mary Curzon went on an excursion to this region. To their matter of surprise they found no signs of rhinos in the concerned area which is known as the home to them and so she decided to put some serious efforts towards their conservation, sine poaching for their skin was on the heights during that time. It was in the year 1905, June 1st that Mary Curzon proposed the idea of converting Kaziranga into a reserve forest by extending the area into 232 sq km.</p>
<p>Today this park is home to around two-third of world's great one-horned Indian rhinos. Besides, with the highest density of tigers among the protected areas of the world, Kaziranga in the year 2006 was also declared as a tiger reserve. The park also boasts has large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo and swamp deer. In addition, Kaziranga is recognized as an 'Important Bird Area' by Birdlife International for the conservation of avifaunal species.</p>
<p> Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.Kaziranga has been the target of several natural and man-made calamities in recent decades. Floods caused by the overflow of the river Brahmaputra, leading to significant losses of animal life. Encroachment by people along the periphery has also led to a diminished forest cover and a loss of habitat. An ongoing separatist movement in Assam led by the United Liberation Front of Assam  has crippled the economy of the region, but Kaziranga has remained unaffected by the movement; indeed, instances of rebels from the United Liberation Front of Assam protecting the animals and, in extreme cases, killing poachers, have been reported since the 1980s.</p>
